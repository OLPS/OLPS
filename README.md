OLPS
====

OLPS is an open-source toolbox for On-Line Portfolio Selection, which includes a collection of classical and state-of-the-art on-line portofolio selection strategies implemented in Matlab/Octave.

QUICK START
===========

* OLPS_gui.m
  run the OLPS toolbox in the GUI mode (recommended, available only in Matlab)

* OLPS_cli.m 	
  run the OLPS toolbox in the Command Line Interface (CLI) (for both Matlab and octave)

Please let us know how you use OLPS, and help us develop a better toolbox if possible. 

INSTALLATION
============

* Unzip the file you just downloaded and copy the OLPS directory to a location,e.g.,/my-directory/

* Run Matlab/Ocatve, Go to /my-directory/OLPS/ at the command prompt

* run 'OLPS_gui' (Matlab) or 'OLPS_cli' (Ocatve)

Let us know if there is any error when running the above. 

ENVIRONMENT
===========

The toolbox has been tested in Matlab 2012b (64-bit and 32-bit) under three major OS: Windows 7/8 (64-bit and 32-bit), Linux (Red-Hat Enterprise Linux) (64-bit and 32-bit) and Mac OS X. The toolbox is also compatable for Octave (version 3.8.0) in the command-line interface (CLI) under three major OS: Windows 7, Linux (64-bit and 32-bit), and Mac OS X.
